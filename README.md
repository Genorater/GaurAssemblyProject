# Gaur Assembly Project
This repository contains custom scripts to analyse the gaur assembly. It also contains some scripts used for specific analyses of gene gains/losses and positive selection analyses.

## Table of contents
All scripts are given in the scripts directory. Description, specific scripts and datasets for the genome assembly and other analyses are given in the directories below in this repository:

* Divergent_region_analysis
* Assembly_analysis

Here is a brief description of the contents of each directory.

### Divergent_region_analysis
This folder contains analysis of the divergent region identified on chromosome 15.

### Assembly_analysis
From contig to final ARS_UOA_Gaur_1 assembly, checking of the assembly metric such as N50, repeat analysis etc are done here.

### CAFE_gene_gains_and_losses_analysis
Read CAFE output and selected the gene evolution on gaur branch for GO and KEGG pathway analysis.

### PAML_positive_selection_analysis
This folder contains the scripts to caculate the p-values for positive selected sites by reading log Like
